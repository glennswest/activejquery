============

May 14 2009 - Added support for one line controller.

May 15 2009 - Fixed ProtectFromForgery for add and delete.
              Moved from using editdata for Forgery Protection,
                 to using the edit url, for all edit/add/delete.
              Fixed Paging offset that was not showing the first
                 10 records.
              Fixed a typo where the wrong model was used for updates
              Merged in public/css and javascripts code to plubin
